# Olympic Games Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides a high-level analysis of the Olympic Games dataset (Summer and Winter editions). By aggregating historical data, we identify significant trends in global participation, the rise of new sports, and the shift towards gender equality in athletics.

## Key Insights

### 1. Global Participation Growth
*   **Expansion:** The Olympics have grown from a small event in 1896 to a massive global phenomenon. The number of participating nations (Codes) has steadily increased, particularly after the 1960s and 1990s (post-Cold War era).
*   **Summer vs. Winter:** Summer Games consistently host more countries and athletes than Winter Games, though Winter Games have seen their own steady growth in niche disciplines.

### 2. Medal Dominance
*   **Historical Leaders:** The United States, Soviet Union (historical data), and European nations (like Great Britain, France, Germany) have historically dominated the medal tallies.
*   **Emerging Nations:** In recent decades, we see a broader distribution of medals, with nations like China rising to prominence in the Summer Games.

### 3. Gender Equality Trends
*   **Early Era:** Early Olympic editions were overwhelmingly male-dominated.

### 4. Sporting Evolution

*   **Core Sports:** Athletics (Track & Field) and Aquatics remain the cornerstone of the Summer Games, contributing the highest volume of medals.
